# RefleXOX
 A competitive TicTacToe game that has various new features.

## Rules and Features

* Each RefleXOX game has a certain number of rounds. (6, 12 or 20)

-The player with symbol X starts at odd numbered rounds. 

-The player with symbol O starst at even numbered ones. 

* There are timers that measures the time spent by players for each move they make.

-First move of each round is not included to this. 

* When a player wins a round, they get 100 points and the time they have spent for that round is removed from the winner's timer.

* When the rounds are over, we find the difference between the total seconds spent by each player and multiply it with 30. We add this number to the total points of the player which has spent less time than the other.

* There are two modes by now:

**Unknown symbols:** X and O symbols are replaced with an unknown one. 

**Hidden symbols:** Previous symbols are disappearing after each move.
